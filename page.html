    <p class="thanks">Dear Bianca, who I have the pleasure to call ‘Meu amor’. <br>
I decided to write this letter differently than the others because we have a special story love a bit different than the many stories.  I want to express the feelings that I have for you, feelings of joy, thankless, love, satisfaction, contentment, happiness, and many others. I want to thank you for any happiness we have, any pain supported, any excited memories lived together, and beautiful dreams shared.</p>

        <h2>When I meet you</h2>
        <p>For the first time I saw you, I never imagined that one day I would love you the way I love you today, to me, you were just another brave gen to love like everybody, looking past I think: “God is full of surprises”. In Loppiano He gave many beautiful and great gifts to my happiness, also you are my gift.</p>

            <div class="card" id="top1Card2"></div>
        </div>
        <p>I Like to see how things happened, non one planned anything, we were just in our schools living in the present moment, enjoying friends, celebrating the mass in Theotoko playing, singing, and living in a family atmosphere, but time was passing, and you were becoming special to me. 
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="momento">
        <h2>We became closer</h2>
        <p>You know I loved the way you became closer to me, I always dreamed be loved by someone who decided to be near to me because wants to be near, someone who find excuses to be close, and from this will be born a  friendship, born at Christmas, grown with horse’s help and with many other circumstances.
        </p>

        <div class="card" id="top1Card7"></div>
        <div class="card" id="top1Card8"></div>
    </div>
    <p>And from that friendship was borned a love, initially “forbidden”, as a beautiful and emotional love story. Maybe if we write a book we can become rich, what do you think?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="momento">
        <h2>We fell in love</h2>
        <p>Yes, we were. What do we expect? I like to kiss, you like to be kissed, I like a hug, you like to be hugged, I like to do someone laugh, and you like someone who makes you laugh, I like someone who pays attention to me, you pay attention to me, I like to be closer to someone, and you came close, results, we fell in love.</p>
        <p>What a beautiful wonder, and a genuine love to be appreciated forever.
